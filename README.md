# PassRemember
Simple Java console application to manage your accounts and passwords.

Made in order to practice some Java while building an useful tool to myself. 
Feel free to do anything with the code in this project.

Resulting files are NOT encrypted in any way, even though they are serialized objects, as encrypting without somewhere to hide the "key" would be worthless, and Java is easy to decompile. (Using obfuscation is not desired in any way here).

Initial password is just a confirmation, it is 27, could be anything you want just modifying the code.
